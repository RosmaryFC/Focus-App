## The Problem 
Describe the problem that your app will address. This does not need to be a novel idea or product, but your app should not directly recreate an existing product. If you are basing the app on an existing product, there should be some edge to your design or feature that solves a problem with that existing product.   

In this section, please frame the issue with supporting statistics about the need (market size, competitors, use cases). You should fully think through your user - who is your user? Why do they need this app? How are they using it?   

Problem: Many phone users have a phone addiction, which makes it difficult for them to manage their time wisely. 

## The Solution 
Please provide a detailed description of the app here. Map out how the app solves the problem described in section I. You should also include:
  *  Baseline features you plan to implement by Demo 1 (what + why).
  *  Bonus features you plan to implement if baseline features are completed in time (what + why).
  *  A wireframe of the app. 

Our app will help users become aware of their phone addiction and limit their time  on their phones to stay focused on other priorities.

## Execution
Please describe how you will build this app. Include: 
August | 7-9 | Brainstorm ideas, create userflows, and submit project proposal.
August |10-11| User testing using prototypes for user feedback.Check-in on August 11th. 
August |12-15| Building the layout and assigning priority features. Check-in on August 14th. 
August |16-20| Complete priority features (userflows and user testing).
August |21-25| Work on bonus features.
August |26-28| Polish app, user testing and check for bug fixes. 

  *  A detailed timeline for building the product, broken out by weekly sprints. Implement the training from the [Project Management workshop](https://github.com/accesscode-2-1/unit-3/blob/master/lessons/16_ProjectManagement.md) to plan your sprints and outline which features you want to build out over the next 4 weeks. Think about the user stories you would frame your sprints around. *Projects should be planned to complete the build by Demo 1 on September 1, 2015.*  
  *  A breakdown of team member responsibilities. Team members should take ownership over a specific feature or aspect of the app.
