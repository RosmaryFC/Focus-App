### The Problem 

Many phone users have a phone addiction, which makes it difficult for them to dedicate their time to other important priorities manage their time wisely. With the latest phones and gadgets out, it has become habitual for users to be on their devices 24/7, affecting their daily lifestyles. 

 Focus-App is an app that helps you minimize the use of your phone by allowing you to create a schedule, or import a previously made schedule (such as google calendar), where you can set specific times that you know you would not want to use your phone. This will allow users to limit themselves on specific apps and help manage their time to be more productive.

### The Solution 

Our app will help users become aware of their phone addiction by providing app usage feedback as well as time productivity feedback in the form of a graph. Users will be able to create or import their own schedules determining when they can and cannot use certain apps on their phones which will limit app usage not just overall but when limited app usage is needed the most. Users can also create a to-do list with to-do items in which they can also set specific times aside for these items where they cannot use certain apps on their phones. An intensity feature will allow the user to set how badly they want the app to kick them off an app (the three intensities would be Friendly, Stern Parent, or Drill sargeant). There will be a feature for leaniency where the user will have 3 lives which they can use if they want to extend their time on an app or access a blocked app for a set amount of time.
