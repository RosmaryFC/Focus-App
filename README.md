During hours dedicated to study or work, smart phone users tend to get easily distracted by entertaining apps. This distraction can lead up to hours of time lost that could have been used productively for other things such as sleep, exercising, studying, or spending time with your family and friends.

Block On is set out to help smart phone users of any age who have helplessly found themselves constantly being sucked into their phones and not getting the things they want done, gain back the countrol to focus on tasks at hand.

It's easy, just choose which apps are most distracting to you, and those will be the apps Block On will monitor.
Next, create Future Block Sessions for when you would like to dedicate time to tasks without distractions.
Now all you need to do is go about your regular day knowing Block On has your back by making sure that you don't lose focus!

Block On is the friend you need to help you focus and achieve your goals. Because it's not only an app that helps you concentrate momentarily, Block On will have a positive impact on your productivity and you will see yourself forming good work / study / sleep / habits (just to name a few) by allowing Block On to be a part of your every day life.
