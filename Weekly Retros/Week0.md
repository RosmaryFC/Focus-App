**Guiding Questions** (consider before the meeting):

**Team Member Analysis**:

  *  Team Member #1 - Sarah
    * Goals/Responsibilities Last Week: 
     - Create Service to choose one app to monitor and prevent it from opening during focus session
     - list all apps on phone in a list so user can choose to turn monitoring on or off
        * Did you meet your goals/responsibilities last week? Why or why not?
         - Yes. We were able to test a hardcoded time to block a specific app from opening and it was successful
    * Goals/Responsibilities This Week:
     - fix issue where list view of apps only toggles one app at a time (not all subsequent apps following in listview)
     - Constantly check which apps to be monitored without running out of memory
     - refactor code for service classes that were created
     - Create a listview of apps that are currently being monitored (for home screen)
     - check app log for lollipop

  *  Team Member #2 - Janneisy
    * Goals/Responsibilities Last Week:

         * Did you meet your goals/responsibilities last week? Why or why not?
          -Yes. the layouts are available in the project. The linking of the layouts need to be completed.

  *  Team Member #3 - Rosemary
    * Goals/Responsibilities Last Week:

     - create listView for focus sessions created
        * Did you meet your goals/responsibilities last week? Why or why not?
        - No. the focus session listView has not been created - our main priority was to get our mvp working so I dedicated time to look into services.

    - create listView for focus sessions created
    - save focus session info into database
    - create option to grab info from focus session and use it with service

**Additional Potential Discussion Topics**:

  *  Compare your work planned with what your work completed.
   - We wanted to be able to show that this app was possible to make and we were able to by blocking one app.
  *  Is the divison of roles within your team working?
   - Yes. we all have different roles but we also help each other out.
  *  How is communication and collaboration between team members?
   - good communication and collaboration. We speak of our concerns and recommendations.
  *  Are you getting adequate support? How are you reviewing code?
   - At least one other person from the group has to approve the pull request.
   - Our Mentor is giving us feedback and has joined our slack group for a more immediate response
  *  How can you improve productivity and get the most work done within the next week?
   - create minor todo's  and set goals to complete them on certain days of the week

**Mentor Comments**:
 - possible battery issue due to service constantly running
 - might consider changing approach to lock screen of blocking user from certain apps only (due to using resources such as phone log that are not meant to do that) - jan had idea of math problem on lock screen
 - isn't something android intended you to do.
 - try to get it working in one platform first (kit kat)
 - since you have to write code for another platform reuse as much code as possible
